## Task 1: App Service Web App (15 points)

### Evidence 1.1: Forked Repository

![Forked Repo](docs/forked-github-repo.png)

Description: This screenshot proves the CS487-PA4 starter repository was successfully forked to my personal GitHub account, which now acts as the central source code repository and deployment trigger for the Azure Web App

### Evidence 1.2: App Service Overview

![Web App Overview](docs/web_app_overview.png)

Resource group: rg-sp26-27100289

Region: UK West

Runtime: Node 22 LTS (Node 20 LTS was not available on the portal, I searched it but it did not appear in the search results).

Public URL: pa4-27100289.azurewebsites.net

### Evidence 1.3: Deployment Center / GitHub Actions

![Deployment Centre](docs/deployment_centre.png)

Description: This illustrates the Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) configuration linking the Azure Web App to the main branch of my GitHub fork. It demonstrates the use of a GitHub Actions workflow, authenticated via a publish profile, to automatically build the webapp/ directory and deploy the code to Azure

### Evidence 1.4: Live Web UI

![Live Web UI](docs/web_app_page.png)

Description: This screenshot captures the live TaskFlow frontend accessible over HTTPS in a browser, confirming that the Node.js application was successfully built and is being served by the Azure App Service

### Evidence 1.5: App Settings

![App Settings](docs/app_settings.png)

Description: This verifies the configuration of the FUNCTION_START_URL and FUNCTION_STATUS_URL environment variables within the Azure Portal

---

## Task 2: Azure Container Registry (15 points)

### Evidence 2.1: ACR Overview

![ACR Overview](docs/acr_overview.png)

Description: SKU: Basic and Resource group: rg-sp26-27100289

### Evidence 2.2: Docker Builds

![Validate Image](docs/validate_api_image.png)
![Report Image](docs/report_job_image.png)
![Func Image](docs/function_app_image.png)

Description: The validate-api:latest image was built from the ./validate-api directory, the report-job:latest image from the ./report-job directory, and the func-app:latest image from the ./function-app directory

### Evidence 2.3: Testing validate api

![Test](docs/validator_test.png)

Description: The screenshot shows a curl POST request sent to localhost:8080/validate and the container successfully returning the expected JSON response ({"valid":true}), proving the application logic functions correctly before cloud deployment

### Evidence 2.4: Pushing images

![Push](docs/validate_report_push.png)
![Func Push](docs/function_app_push.png)

Description: These screenshots show the local images being successfully tagged with the pa427100289.azurecr.io login server prefix and pushed to the cloud using the docker push command

### Evidence 2.5: ACR Repositories

![Verification](docs/verification.png)

Description: This screenshot confirms that all three required container repositories—validate-api:v1, report-job:v1, and func-app:v1—were successfully published to Azure

---

## Task 3: Durable Function Implementation (12 points)

### Evidence 3.1: Completed Function Code

[function_app.py](function-app/function_app.py)

Description: This file contains the complete Durable Function logic, demonstrating the sequential chaining of activities. The orchestrator uses the yield keyword to pause and checkpoint execution while calling validate_activity, disrupts the workflow if the order is rejected, and only proceeds to trigger report_activity if the validation is successful.

### Evidence 3.2: Local Function Handler Listing

TODO: ![Func Start](docs/func_start.png)

Description: This screenshot verifies that the local Azure Functions Core Tools successfully compiled the Python code and registered all four required Durable Function handlers (the HTTP starter, the orchestrator, and the two activity triggers) without any binding errors.

---

## Task 4: Function App Container Deployment (8 points)

![error](docs/error.png)
There was a naming conflict for the function app so I named to to pa4-func-27100289

### Evidence 4.1: Function App Container Configuration

![container](docs/container_image.png)

Description: TODO: Function app name: pa4-func-27100289 and image URI: pa427100289.azurecr.io/func-app:v1

### Evidence 4.2: Functions List

![functions](docs/functions_list.png)

Description: This screenshot confirms that the container deployed successfully and the Azure Functions runtime recognized the four required Durable Function components: http_starter, my_orchestrator, validate_activity, and report_activity

### Evidence 4.3: Orchestration Smoke Test

![curl](docs/curl_output.png)

Description: The returned id and statusQueryGetUri prove that the http_starter function successfully received the curl POST request, authenticated using the function key, and correctly initialized a new instance of the Durable Orchestrator (my_orchestrator). It also confirms that the Function App is properly connected to its underlying Azure Storage account to track orchestration state.

### Evidence 4.4: Expected Failed Status Before Downstream Wiring

![failure](docs/uri_json.png)

Description: This failure is expected at this stage because the orchestration successfully started and moved to the first activity (validate_activity), which attempts to make an HTTP call to the VALIDATE_URL. Since the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) validator microservice is not deployed and wired up until Task 5, the network call fails, causing the orchestration to correctly checkpoint as Failed.

---

## Task 5: AKS Validator (15 points)

### Evidence 5.1: Kubernetes Nodes

![nodes](docs/get_nodes.png)

Description: This screenshot shows the kubectl get nodes output, confirming that the AKS cluster is successfully provisioned and the single Standard_B2s worker node is authenticated and in a Ready state.

### Evidence 5.2: Kubernetes Pods

![pods](docs/get_pods.png)

Description: The kubectl get pods output confirms that the validate-api deployment successfully pulled the container image from the Azure Container Registry. The pod is now scheduled and actively Running on the worker node.

### Evidence 5.3: Kubernetes Service

![service](docs/get_service.png)

Description: The kubectl get service output demonstrates that the Azure LoadBalancer successfully provisioned a public IP address (51.140.204.239) for the validate-service. This exposes the internal validator API on port 8080 to the public internet so it can receive HTTP traffic.

### Evidence 5.4: Validator API Tests

![health](docs/health.png)
![checks](docs/validity_checks.png)

Description: These curl tests verify the API's logic over the internet. The accepted path (O-1001) correctly returns {"valid": true} because the requested quantity (2) is valid. The rejected path (O-1002) correctly returns {"valid": false} and specifies the reason, because the item quantity (999) triggers the validation rule that rejects orders where qty > 100

### Evidence 5.5: Function App `VALIDATE_URL`

![func](docs/func_app_settings.png)

Description: This shows the Function App's configuration updated with the VALIDATE_URL. The Durable Function's validate_activity uses this exact endpoint (http://51.140.204.239:8080/validate) to securely route the order payload from the orchestrator to the AKS cluster for validation during every pipeline run

---

## Task 6: ACI Report Job (15 points)

### Evidence 6.1: Blob Container

![container](docs/container.png)

Description: The generated PDF reports are stored in a dedicated blob container named reports within the Azure Storage Account (pa427100289). This container acts as the final destination for the "ephemeral" ACI job, providing persistent storage for reports that would otherwise be lost when the container instance terminates.

### Evidence 6.2: Manual ACI Run

![success](docs/pdf_success.png)

Description: The final state of the container is terminated (succeeded). Because the ACI was configured with a RestartPolicy of Never, it does not attempt to reboot after the Python script finishes its execution. This is intentional for "task-based" workloads that perform a single job and then shut down to save costs.

### Evidence 6.3: ACI Logs

![success](docs/pdf_success.png)

Description: The logs show the Python runtime successfully initializing, generating the PDF, and then outputting the confirmation message: Successfully uploaded [ORDER_ID.pdf to reports container.

### Evidence 6.4: Generated PDF

![success](docs/pdf_success.png)

Description: The presence of the file in the Azure Portal's Storage Explorer proves that the ACI successfully bridged the network and security gap. It demonstrates that the container had the necessary write permissions to perform the operation against the storage service.

### Evidence 6.5: Function App Managed Identity and IAM

![identity](docs/managed_identity.png)

Description: The Function App requires the Contributor (or a custom ACI-specific) role at the Resource Group scope. This is because the Function App acts as an orchestrator; it must have permission to programmatically "create" and "delete" other Azure resources (the ACI instances) via the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) API.

### Evidence 6.6: Report App Settings

![envvar1](docs/envvar_1.png)
![envvar2](docs/envvar_2.png)

Description: The environment variables are split into three functional groups:

Registry Auth: (ACR_USER, ACR_PASS) used by the ACI host to pull the private image from the Azure Container Registry.

Infrastructure Target: (STORAGE_ACCOUNT_URL, STORAGE_CONN) defines where the container should upload the final report.

Application Context: (ORDER_ID, ORDER_JSON) provides the specific business data the container needs to render the content of the PDF.

---

## Task 7: End-to-End Pipeline (15 points)

### Evidence 7.1: Web App Wiring

![web](docs/web_config.png)

Description: The frontend utilizes the asynchronous HTTP API pattern required by Azure Durable Functions. When a user submits an order, the Web App sends an HTTP POST request to the http_starter function. The Function App immediately returns an HTTP 202 (Accepted) response containing management endpoints, including a statusQueryGetUri. The frontend's JavaScript then actively polls this status URI at regular intervals, updating the UI state based on the runtimeStatus until it reads Completed or Failed.

### Evidence 7.2: Happy Path UI

![form](docs/form.png)
![completed](docs/completed.png)
![running](docs/running.png)
![pdf](docs/pdf.png)

Description: This sequence demonstrates a successful end-to-end execution. A valid order payload (with a quantity well below the threshold of 100) is submitted via the form. The UI correctly transitions to a "Running" state, displaying the unique orchestration instance ID while polling the backend. Once the orchestration finishes, the UI updates to "Completed" and dynamically renders the direct blob storage URL. The final downloaded PDF confirms the data payload was accurately passed from the frontend all the way to the reporting container.

### Evidence 7.3: Backend Participation

![aci](docs/spawned_aci.png)
![container](docs/container_pdf.png)
![aks_logs](docs/aks_logs.png)

Description: By tracing a specific Order ID through the system logs, we verify the distributed participation of all microservices. First, the AKS pod logs confirm that the validate_activity successfully routed the traffic to the cluster, which parsed and validated the payload. Following validation, the az container list output proves the orchestrator dynamically provisioned a temporary ACI (ci-report-[order_id]) to execute the report_activity. Finally, the storage container view confirms the ACI successfully completed its job by writing the PDF to Blob Storage before being deleted.

Note: Due to the strict Azure Policy restrictions enforced within the university's lab environment, I was unable to provision an Azure Application Insights resource (or a Log Analytics Workspace). Application Insights is a strict prerequisite for the Function App's "Monitor -> Invocations" dashboard to capture and display historical execution data. Because the resource creation was blocked by policy, the Invocations UI remains unpopulated, and I cannot provide a screenshot of this specific view. However, the successful orchestration of both activities is proven by the final "Completed" state in the Web App UI and the successful generation of the PDF in the Blob container.

### Evidence 7.4: Reject Path UI

![failure](docs/failure_msg.png)

Description: This sequence demonstrates the orchestrator's short-circuit logic. An invalid order (e.g., quantity > 100) is submitted, which causes the AKS validator to return a valid: false response. The Durable Orchestrator evaluates this result and immediately halts execution, returning a "rejected" status to the polling Web App. Because the workflow exits early, the report_activity is never invoked. This prevents the unnecessary provisioning of an ACI and saves compute costs, proving the orchestration handles business logic failures gracefully.

## Task 8: Write-up and Architecture Diagram (5 points)

### Evidence 8.1: Architecture Diagram

![architecture](docs/27100289_architecture_diagram.png)

It shows GitHub, App Service, Durable Function, AKS, ACI, Blob Storage, ACR, and IAM.

### Question 8.2: Service Selection

App Service
The PA uses App Service to host the frontend web interface because it provides a fully managed environment optimized for web applications. It abstracts away underlying server maintenance and provides built-in HTTPS, load balancing, and scaling. This allows the system to reliably serve the frontend to users without requiring infrastructure management.

Durable Functions
Durable Functions acts as the central stateful orchestrator for the backend workflow. It allows the system to reliably coordinate API calls (AKS validation and ACI provisioning) while automatically managing execution state and retries. Because it is serverless, it can "sleep" while waiting for the ACI job to finish without consuming active compute resources.

AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)
AKS is utilized for the order validation service because it provides an always-on, highly available environment. The validator requires continuous uptime and instant response capabilities to process incoming HTTP requests from the orchestrator without cold starts. Kubernetes allows this API to be resilient and easily scalable if validation traffic spikes.

ACI (Azure Container Instances)
ACI is used for the PDF report generation because it is perfectly suited for ephemeral, isolated batch jobs. Instead of running a heavy reporting container 24/7, ACI allows the orchestrator to dynamically spin up compute on-demand strictly for the duration of the PDF rendering. Once the file is uploaded to blob storage, the container terminates, ensuring resources are freed immediately.

### Question 8.3: ACI vs AKS

Idle Behavior:
AKS remains running continuously ("always on"), with its pods and underlying nodes idling while waiting for incoming HTTP traffic. In contrast, ACI completely terminates when its execution finishes, meaning it does not exist in an idle state; it is either actively running a job or deleted.

Cost Behavior:
Because AKS requires persistent virtual machines to host its node pool, it incurs continuous hourly compute charges regardless of whether the validator is processing orders. ACI utilizes a serverless consumption model, meaning costs are strictly tied to per-second billing for the exact CPU and memory used during the brief lifespan of the report generation.

Operational Model:
AKS requires managing complex cluster infrastructure, including node pools, deployments, and routing manifests, making it ideal for persistent microservices. ACI operates on a serverless container model where Azure abstracts away orchestration entirely, allowing developers to execute a single, isolated container image via an API call without managing the underlying host.

### Question 8.4: Durable Functions vs Plain HTTP

Handling Long-Running Processes: A plain HTTP request would time out or drop the connection while waiting minutes for the ACI container to pull its image, boot, and generate the PDF. Durable Functions solves this by implementing an async polling pattern (returning a 202 Accepted immediately) so the Web App can safely check the status without keeping a fragile network connection open.

State and Control Flow Management: Coordinating a multi-step workflow using plain HTTP requires building complex custom logic to handle retries, store intermediate states, and manage failures. Durable Functions solves this by natively providing an orchestration context (e.g., yield context.call_activity()), making it easy to write sequential code that automatically tracks history and can elegantly short-circuit if an earlier step (like the AKS validation) fails.

### Question 8.5: Cost Review

![rg](docs/resource_group.png)
<img width="1919" height="854" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1ee735a-2c78-4feb-a2c4-bd957d030337" />

Description: The most expensive resource in the deployment is the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) node pool. This is because AKS requires dedicated, always-on Virtual Machines to run the Kubernetes control plane components and the worker nodes hosting the validator pods. Unlike the serverless resources (Durable Functions, ACI) which only bill per execution, or the basic App Service plan, the AKS nodes incur continuous hourly compute compute charges 24/7, regardless of how much traffic the system is actually handling.

### Question 8.6: Challenges Faced

Challenge 1: Azure Policy Deadlock with Storage Authentication
During the implementation of the report_activity, the ACI container repeatedly failed to upload the generated PDF to Blob Storage. Initially, attempting to authenticate using the storage account connection string resulted in a KeyBasedAuthenticationNotPermitted error because the university's Azure Policy strictly disables Shared Key access. I then attempted to use a Managed Identity, but hit a secondary policy block: my student subscription lacked the RBAC permissions (User Access Administrator) required to assign the Storage Blob Data Contributor role to the identity.

Resolution: To debug, I used a User Delegation SAS token. I utilized the Azure CLI (az storage container generate-sas --as-user) to generate a temporary SAS token, which already had the necessary permissions. I then injected this SAS_TOKEN and the STORAGE_ACCOUNT_URL into the ACI as environment variables, allowing the containerized Python script to securely authenticate and write the PDF.

Challenge 2: Durable Functions Route Registration Failure (404 Cannot POST)
While wiring the frontend to the backend orchestrator, the Web App consistently returned a Cannot POST /api/orchestrators/my_orchestrator (404 Not Found) error. This indicated that the Azure Functions host was up, but the specific route didn't exist.

Resolution: I debugged this by wrapping the http_starter function in a try catch block, which revealed that the host was crashing during startup and failing to index my functions. The root cause was a subtle type-hinting error in my function_app.py code. The HTTP starter function was defined as async def http_starter(req: func.HttpRequest, client: str):. In the Python V2 model, the Durable Functions extension expects to inject a complex DurableOrchestrationClient object. Forcing the type hint to str caused the underlying binding reflection to fail, preventing the function from ever registering its HTTP route. By simply removing the : str type hint, the host successfully initialized the function, and the orchestrator was able to accept the POST request.
